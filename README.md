# like-button-php
facebook-like like button with php, ajax, and mysql

Note: make your own database credentials, in my case: 
DB name => likes
Table => likes
user => root
pass => root

This is a sample code for a facebook-like Like button made with PHP native, and Ajax to prevent page refresh with every request.
